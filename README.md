# nordvpn_switcher

clone from project here or pip install - https://pypi.org/project/nordvpn-switcher/

lots of configs and settings available in the above link...

My test file is taking all servers nord has in ireland and rotating them every 30 mins so I bypass the captchas.

add test.py into working directory and enjoy a rotating vpn
